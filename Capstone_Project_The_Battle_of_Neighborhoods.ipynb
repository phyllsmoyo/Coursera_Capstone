        "Education is important for everyone in the world. Education is the process of achieving knowledge, values, skills, beliefs, and moral habits. For any country education enables people become better citizens, get a better-paid job, shows the difference between good and bad. Education shows us the importance of hard work and, at the same time, helps us grow and develop. Thus, we are able to shape a better society to live in by knowing and respecting rights, laws, and regulations. People without an education hardly get by in life because education teaches us how to think, how to work properly, and how to make decisions. The better the education, the more choices and opportunities one is going to have in life."
